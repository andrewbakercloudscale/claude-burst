# Puts burst-off on the PATH: one command that turns Claude Burst off and gets
# Claude Code working again, for whoever is stuck and has no idea where the
# repo went. It is scripts/rollback.sh, copied with the two helpers it calls,
# so a moved or deleted checkout cannot take it away. burst-on turns Burst
# back on.
#
# burst-reinstall goes with it: scripts/reinstall.sh, which fetches the newest
# Burst and installs it again, and the path of this checkout for it to use.
# The mod's /claude-burst-revert and /claude-burst-reinstall run the two.
#
# verify-release.sh and release-signers are copied too: the copy outside the
# checkout is what reinstall and repair check a fetched release against, so
# what they trust is what was installed, not what was just downloaded.
#
# Called by install.sh and by both endings of deploy.sh, so the copy never
# lags the rollback.sh it came from. Never fails its caller.
